           <p>Dr John H. Watson is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is 
            arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.

           In the debut Holmes story 'A Study in Scarlet', Watson, as the narrator, describes meeting Holmes, 
           their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street, his attempts to discover the profession of his 
           taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual taking of Watson into his confidence, and the events surrounding 
           their first case together. Watson describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner 
               for Holmes' taste. In time, they become close friends.</p>

         <p> In 'The Sign of Four', John Watson met Mary Morstan, who became his wife. Mary seemed somewhat less sure of 
           her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him 'James' in the short story 'The Man With the Twisted Lip'.

           This may be a simple typographical error, though some have speculated that it is a wifely reference to Watson's
           unknown middle name, which could have been 'Hamish' (Scottish for 'James'). Dorothy Sayers, creator of the
           detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later publishing this 
           theory in 'Unpopular Opinions'.</p>
