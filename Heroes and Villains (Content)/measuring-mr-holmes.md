Measuring Mr Holmes
===================

I'd like you to include a page with some data on your site, so that you have an opportunity to explore visualising data. I don't have content for this page, but I'd like to tell the story of Sherlock Holmes through data somehow.

You can use your own self-generated data or you can use data from Randall Stock's website:

http://www.bestofsherlock.com/story/storyhm.htm

As you'll see in the notes on this file, Randall has a couple of conditions if you use his data. If you choose to visualise the data he has gathered, please follow his conditions.

I also found another page – 'A Statistical Analysis of the Sherlock Holmes Stories' – which might be useful:

I'll leave this up to you as to how best to proceed.
