This is the home page content. It's as I've written it, you can add to it or edit it if you like. In a typical design process, I'd probably make suggestions to the client around changes to the copy, feel free to do so. Or you can use this copy as is.

There is further material available in the `notes.md` file that I've supplied.

IMDers: Think of Paul as your client. IxDers: Think of me as your client. (That way we can discuss your design in the labs.)

It's up to you how you handle the content in the website. You'll of course need to consider the words (so there will be an emphasis on typography), but you might also consider: illustrations (vector, hand drawn, photographic…); iconography; and other elements.

The Life and Times of Sherlock Holmes
-------------------------------------

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's celebrated Sherlock Holme's characters have captured the minds of countless admirers – young and old – over the years. 

A fictional private detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Holmes is known for his proficiency with observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning. His powers of deduction border on the fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.

Holmes has lived a life beyond the printed page. Recent adaptations, brought to life on the silver screen, include: Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman's portrayal in 'Sherlock'; Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal in 'Mr Holmes'; and – more recently – Will Ferrell and John C Reilly's portrayal in 'Holmes & Watson'.

Conan Doyle's writings live on from generation to generation. As Scott Monty – a member of the Sherlock Holmes Enthusiast Group 'Baker Street Irregulars' – puts it:

> Every generation or so, some kind of cycle happens, some big book or movie begins to start the process and then others seem to follow up.

This little web site is a homage to the Sherlock Holmes' story and was created as a piece of coursework for the 'Narrative and Storytelling' module at Belfast School of Art.
