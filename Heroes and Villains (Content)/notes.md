Notes
=====

This is the raw text for a website you'll be creating for the Narrative and Storytelling module.

You need to firstly mark everything up in Plain Old Semantic HTML (POSH). This content can be marked up as a single page site or a multi-page site, but consider semantics (HTML) and links (URLs). Once you've marked up your content you have two deliverables:

1. Build an initial immersive prototype (using XD, InVision, Figma, or similar) designed as part of a first design sprint. The deadline for this is for a critique in Week 6.

2. Build a finished website (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that iterates upon the initial immersive prototype and is designed as part of a second design sprint. The deadline for this is for a critique in Week 12.

Your website should be responsive and should work on mobile, tablet and desktop.

**Please do not dive right into the final build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.** What we want to see is a design process that:

1. Starts with visual research;
2. Moves on to the creation of wireframes, mockups and prototypes (Weeks 1-6);
3. Before finally moving onto the final build.

**We are not looking for a straight out of the tin Bootstrap site, we're looking for something more considered and bespoke.**

You may wish to add links to the content supplied, or supplement the content, where appropriate.

â€”Christopher Murphy


Here's how I'd structure the site:

1. The Life and Times of Sherlock Holmes (Home)
2. Heroes and Villains
  + Heroes
    + Sherlock Holmes
    + Dr Watson
  + Villains
    + Moriarty
    + Irene Adler
3. On the Silver Screen
4. Measuring Mr Holmes
5. 221B Baker Street
