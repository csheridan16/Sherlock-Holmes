        <p>Sherlock Holmes has been the subject of countless films over the years, stretching from 
           1939 to the present day. Guinness World Records lists Holmes as, "the most portrayed movie character," with more than 70 actors 
           playing the part in over 200 films. His first screen appearance was in the 1900 Mutoscope film, 
          'Sherlock Holmes Baffled'.What could be better than spending an evening soaking up the spectacle of Sherlock Holmes and his 
           partner-in-crime Dr Watson undertaking a spot of sleuthing. These are just a handful of Holmes' outings on celluloid.</p>

            [Mr Holmes](https://boxd.it/8EBw) is set in 1947, following a long-retired Holmes living in 
            a Sussex village with his housekeeper and rising detective son. Holmes finds himself haunted by an

            fragments of the case: a confrontation with an angry husband, a secret bond with his beautiful but unstable wife.
