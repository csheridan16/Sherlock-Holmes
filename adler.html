     <p>Irene Adler, professionally known as 'The Woman', is a brilliant dominatrix who has an apparently romantic 
            attraction to Sherlock Holmes.

            Whilst Mycroft – Holmes' elder brother (by seven years) – is telling Sherlock about Irene, he states that 
            she is a dominatrix who gives out 'recreational scolding' to people. She has been in the middle of two 
            political scandals in recent years, one of them involving a famous author, in which she had an affair with 
            both sides.</p>

           <p>She is brought to Sherlock's attention when he and John are summoned to Buckingham Palace by Mycroft and 
            are asked to take on a case of national importance. Irene had taken compromising images of a young female 
            member of the British Royal family during a dominatrix session.

            Even though Irene does not want money or power for the pictures, Sherlock is tasked in getting them back. 
            She is using them, and other information for her 'protection'.</p>
