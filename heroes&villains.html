    <h2>Heroes</h2>
    
    

        <h3>Dr Watson</h3>

        <p>Dr John H. Watson is a medical doctor, formerly in the British Army. He was married to Mary Watson and is 
            arguably the only friend and confidant of Sherlock Holmes.

           In the debut Holmes story 'A Study in Scarlet', Watson, as the narrator, describes meeting Holmes, 
           their subsequent sharing of rooms at 221B Baker Street, his attempts to discover the profession of his 
           taciturn companion, Holmes's eventual taking of Watson into his confidence, and the events surrounding 
           their first case together. Watson describes Holmes and his methods in too romantic and sentimental a manner 
           for Holmes' taste. In time, they become close friends.

           In 'The Sign of Four', John Watson met Mary Morstan, who became his wife. Mary seemed somewhat less sure of 
           her husband, however, absentmindedly calling him 'James' in the short story 'The Man With the Twisted Lip'.

           This may be a simple typographical error, though some have speculated that it is a wifely reference to Watson's
           unknown middle name, which could have been 'Hamish' (Scottish for 'James'). Dorothy Sayers, creator of the
           detective Lord Peter Wimsey, who also wrote several essays on Holmesian speculation, later publishing this 
            theory in 'Unpopular Opinions'.</p>

    
    <h2>Villians</h2>
    
         <h2>Moriarty</h2>
         
         <p>Professor James Moriarty, the arch-enemy of Sherlock Holmes, is a mathematics professor turned the world's only
           'consulting criminal'. His genius is equal to, if not perhaps greater than, Holmes himself.

            Moriarty is a machiavellian criminal mastermind whom Holmes describes as the 'Napoleon of crime'. 
            Conan Doyle borrowed this phrase from a Scotland Yard inspector who was referring to Adam Worth, 
            a real-life criminal mastermind, who is one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based.

            The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Conan Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes, 
            and only featured in two of the Sherlock Holmes stories.

            Moriarty is a genius, a philosopher and an abstract thinker, with a brain of the first order. 
            As Holmes puts it: "He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand 
            radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them."

           Despite only appearing in two stories, Moriarty has been proven to be the most dangerous of all criminals 
           that Holmes encounters. In the short story 'The Adventure of the Final Problem', during a fight with Holmes 
           above the Reichenbach Falls, Moriarty falls to his death.</p>  


    
         <h2>Irene Adler</h2>
         
         <p>Irene Adler, professionally known as 'The Woman', is a brilliant dominatrix who has an apparently romantic 
            attraction to Sherlock Holmes.

            Whilst Mycroft – Holmes' elder brother (by seven years) – is telling Sherlock about Irene, he states that 
            she is a dominatrix who gives out 'recreational scolding' to people. She has been in the middle of two 
            political scandals in recent years, one of them involving a famous author, in which she had an affair with 
            both sides.

            She is brought to Sherlock's attention when he and John are summoned to Buckingham Palace by Mycroft and 
            are asked to take on a case of national importance. Irene had taken compromising images of a young female 
            member of the British Royal family during a dominatrix session.

            Even though Irene does not want money or power for the pictures, Sherlock is tasked in getting them back. 
            She is using them, and other information for her 'protection'.</p>
